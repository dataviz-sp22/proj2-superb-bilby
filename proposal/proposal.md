Facets of Wealth Inequality Visualized
================
Superb Bilby

## Goal of this Project

Our high level goal is to create an easily digestible website which
conveys the true scale of global wealth and income inequality.

## Motivation and Questions

Global wealth and income inequality is at an all time high, however, the
magnitude of this inequality is difficult to fathom. Often, the uber
wealthy of society are worshiped for their resilience and innovation,
when in reality they should be scorned for their greed and malice. A
resource that helps people more easily digest the extreme wealth
disparity may shift people away from the deification of the worldâ€™s
oligarchs, and shift people toward the rally against such rapacious
behavior. We aim to answer the following questions in an attempt to
clarify the realities of wealth/income inequality:

What can the wealth of a billionaire accomplish? How many of our worldâ€™s
poorest would it take to match the wealth of our worldâ€™s richest? What
are some ways we can begin to conceptualize how much money the
wealthiest humans actually have? Does anybody really need so much
wealth?

To answer these questions through visualization, we will be relying on
the following datasets:

1)  [The Forbes Billionaireâ€™s
    List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JThOdF95e0NYoea5pCWd5UDXLmIGc1Fwj1aajDSYYhk/edit#gid=685599441).
    The dataset provides information about billionaireâ€™s networths, how
    old they are, what industry they are in, their gender, and their
    location.

2)  [The Wealth Mobility
    Dataset](https://github.com/fpfeffer/WealthMobility/blob/master/Data/2-wealth-structure.csv).
    The dataset breaks down how wealth is divided up by quintiles,
    quartiles, and race. It also provides intra-quartile and quintile
    breakdowns, such as information about the wealthiest quintile within
    the poorest quintile.
